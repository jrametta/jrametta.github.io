This is my blog on cloud and network technologies and solutions.  Writing things down helps me remember stuff
I've done in the past and leaves me with a permanent reference.  It's my hope that it just might occasionally
help someone else out every once and a while too.  I'm a solutions engineer at Brocade hence many of my posts
related to Brocade, but I hope to cover a range of different technologies from different vendors and open 
source communities.
